-++--+|-+-+-+
I look into my glass,
-+-+-+
And view my wasting skin,
-+++-+-+
And say, “Would God it came to pass
-+-+-+
My heart had shrunk as thin!”
-+-+-+
For then, I, undistrest
-+++-+
By hearts grown cold to me,
-+-+-+-+
Could lonely wait my endless rest
-+-+-+
With equanimity.
-+-+-+
But Time to make me grieve,
++-+-+
Part steals, lets part abide;
-+-+-+-+
And shakes this fragile frame at eve
-+--++
With throbbings of noontide.

+--+-+-+-+
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
--+-+-+-+-+
Towards Phoebus’ lodging! Such a wagoner
-+-+-+-+-+
As Phaeton would whip you to the west
-+-+-+-+--+
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
+-++-+-+-+
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
-+--+-+-+-+
That runaways’ eyes may wink, and Romeo
+--+-+-+-+
Leap to these arms untalked of and unseen.
+--+-+-+--+
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
--++-+-+-+
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
-+-+-+++-+
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
-+-+-+-+-+
Thou sober-suited matron all in black,
-+-+-+-+-+
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
+--+-+-+-+
Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
+--+++---+
Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,
--++--++++
With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,
++++-+-+-+
Think true love acted simple modesty.
++++--+-+-+
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
-+-+-+-+-+
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
+--++---+-+
Whiter than new snow upon a Raven’s back.
++-+++-+++
Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-browed night;
+--+--+-+-+
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
+--+-+-+-+
Take him cut him out in little stars,
-+-+-+-+--+
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
-+-+-+-+-+
That all the world will be in love with night
-+++---+-+
And pay no worship to the garish sun.

She dwelt a mong the un trod den ways,
-+-+-+
Be side the springs of Dove,
-+-+-+-+
A maid whom there were none to praise,
-+-+-+
And ver y few to love.
-+-+-+-+
A vio let by a moss y stone
++-+-+
Half hid den from the eye!
+--+-+-+
â€”Fair as a star, when on ly one
-+-+-+
Is shin ing in the sky.
-+-+-+-+
She lived un known, and few could know
-+-+-+
When Lu cy ceased to be;
-+-+-+-+
But she is in her grave, and, oh,
-+-+-+
The diff er ence to me!

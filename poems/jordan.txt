Who says that fictions only and false hair
-+-+-+-+-+-
Become a verse? Is there in truth no beauty?
-+++---+-+
Is all good structure in a winding stair?
-+++-+-+-+-
May no lines pass, except they do their duty
+--+-+-+
Not to a true, but painted chair?
+-++-+-+-+|--++-+-+-+
Is it no verse, except enchanted groves
-+-+-+-+++
And sudden arbors shadow coarse-spun lines?
-+-+-+-+-+
Must purling refresh a lover’s loves?
-+-+-+-+-+
Must all be veiled, while he that reads, divines,
+--+-+-+
Catching the sense at two removes?
+--+-+-+-+
Shepherds are honest people; let them sing:
+--+-+-+-+
Riddle who list, for me, and pull for Prime;
-+-+-+-+-+|-+-+++---+
I envy no man’s nightingale or spring;
+--+-+-+-+
Nor let them punish me with loss of rhyme,
-+-+-+-+
Who plainly say, My God, My King.

undefined
Condemned to Hope’s delusive mine,
undefined
As on we toil from day to day,
undefined
By sudden blasts, or slow decline,
undefined
Our social comforts drop away.
undefined
Well tried through many a varying year,
undefined
See Levet to the grave descend;
undefined
Officious, innocent, sincere,
undefined
Of every friendless name the friend.
undefined
Yet still he fills Affection’s eye,
undefined
Obscurely wise, and coarsely kind;
undefined
Nor, lettered Arrogance, deny
undefined
Thy praise to merit unrefined.
undefined
When fainting Nature called for aid,
undefined
And hovering Death prepared the blow,
undefined
His vigorous remedy displayed
undefined
The power of art without the show.
undefined
In Misery’s darkest cavern known,
undefined
His useful care was ever nigh,
undefined
Where hopeless Anguish poured his groan,
undefined
And lonely Want retired to die.
undefined
No summons mocked by chill delay,
undefined
No petty gain disdained by pride,
undefined
The modest wants of every day
undefined
The toil of every day supplied.
undefined
His virtues walked their narrow round,
undefined
Nor made a pause, nor left a void;
undefined
And sure the Eternal Master found
undefined
The single talent well employed.
undefined
The busy day, the peaceful night,
undefined
Unfelt, uncounted, glided by;
undefined
His frame was firm, his powers were bright,
undefined
Though now his eightieth year was nigh.
undefined
Then with no throbbing fiery pain,
undefined
No cold gradations of decay,
undefined
Death broke at once the vital chain,
undefined
And freed his soul the nearest way.

Con demned to Hope’s de lus ive mine,
undefined
As on we toil from day to day,
undefined
By sud den blasts, or slow de cline,
undefined
Our soc ial com forts drop a way.
undefined
Well tried through man y a var y ing year,
undefined
See Lev et to the grave de scend;
undefined
O ffic ious, inn o cent, sin cere,
undefined
Of ev ery friend less name the friend.
undefined
Yet still he fills A ffec tion’s eye,
undefined
Ob scure ly wise, and coarse ly kind;
undefined
Nor, lett ered Arr o gance, de ny
undefined
Thy praise to mer it un re fined.
undefined
When faint ing Na ture called for aid,
undefined
And hov er ing Death pre pared the blow,
undefined
His vig or ous rem e dy dis played
undefined
The pow er of art with out the show.
undefined
In Mis er y’s dark est cav ern known,
undefined
His use ful care was ev er nigh,
undefined
Where hope less Ang uish poured his groan,
undefined
And lone ly Want re tired to die.
undefined
No summ ons mocked by chill de lay,
undefined
No pet ty gain dis dained by pride,
undefined
The mod est wants of ev ery day
undefined
The toil of ev ery day su pplied.
undefined
His vir tues walked their narr ow round,
undefined
Nor made a pause, nor left a void;
undefined
And sure the E tern al Mast er found
undefined
The sin gle tal ent well em ployed.
undefined
The bus y day, the peace ful night,
undefined
Un felt, un count ed, glid ed by;
undefined
His frame was firm, his pow ers were bright,
undefined
Though now his eight i eth year was nigh.
undefined
Then with no throbb ing fie r y pain,
undefined
No cold gra da tions of de cay,
undefined
Death broke at once the vit al chain,
undefined
And freed his soul the near est way.

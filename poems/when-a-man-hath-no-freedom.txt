--+--+--+--+
When a man hath no freedom to fight for at home,
--+--+--+-
Let him combat for that of his neighbours;
--+--+--+--+
Let him think of the glories of Greece and of Rome,
--+--+--+-
And get knocked on the head for his labours,
--+--+--+--+
To do good to mankind is the chivalrous plan,
--+--+--+-
And is always as nobly requited;
-+--+--+--+
Then battle for freedom wherever you can,
--+--+--+-
And if not shot or hanged youâ€™ll get knighted.

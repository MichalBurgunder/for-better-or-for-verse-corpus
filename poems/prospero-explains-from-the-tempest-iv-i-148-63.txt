-+-+-+-+-+-
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
-+-+--++-+|-+-+-+++--
As I foretold you, were all spirits and
-+-+-+--++
Are melted into air, into thin air;
-+-+-+-+-+-
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
-+++--+-+-+
The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces
-+-+--++-+
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
++-+-+---+|++---+-+-+
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
-+-+-+-+-+-
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
+--+-++--+|+--+-++-++
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
-+-+-+-+-+
As dreams are made on, and our little life
-+-+-++--+
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed.
+--+--++-+-
Bear with my weakness: my old brain is troubled.
-+-+-+-+-+
Be not disturbed with my infirmity.
-+-+-+-+-+
If you be pleased, retire into my cell
-+-+-+-+-+
And there repose. A turn or two Iâ€™ll walk
-+-+-+
To still my beating mind.

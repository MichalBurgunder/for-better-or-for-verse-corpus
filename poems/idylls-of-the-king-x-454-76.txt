He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face
++-+-+---+
Well nigh was helmet-hidden, and the name
-+--+-+-+-+
Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.
-+-+-+-+-+
And Arthur deigned not use word or sword,
-+-+-+-+-+
But let the drunkard, as he stretched from horse
-+-+-+-+-+
To strike him, //overbalancing his bulk,him, overbalancing his bulk,
+--+-+--+-+
Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp
+--+-+++-+|+--+--++-+
Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,
+-++-+-+-+
Heard in dead night along that table-shore,
++-+--++-+
Drops flat, and after the great waters break
+---+-+-+-+
Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,
+--++--+-+
Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,
-+-+-+-+-+
From less and less to nothing; thus he fell
++-+-+-+-+
Head-heavy; then the knights, who watched him, roared
-+--++-+-+-
And shouted and leapt down upon the fallen;
++-+-+---+|-+-+-+-+-+
There trampled out his face from being known,
-+-+-+-+-+
And his head in mire, and slimed themselves:
-+-+--++-+
Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang
-+-+-+-+-+
Through open doors, and swording right and left
++---+-+-+
Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled
-+-+-+-+-+
The tables over and the wines, and slew
-+-+-+-+-+
Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,
-+-+-+-+-+
And all the pavement streamed with massacre.

Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;
-+-+--+-+-+
And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;
-+++-+-+-+
Beyond red roofs about a narrow wharf
-+-+-+-+-+-
In cluster; a mouldered church; and higher
-+++-+++-+
A long street climbs to one tall-towered mill;
-+-+--+--++
And high in heaven behind it a gray down
-+-+-+-+-+
With Danish barrows; and a hazelwood,
-+-+-+-+-+
By autumn nutters haunted, flourishes
+--+++---+|+--+-+-+-+
Green in a cuplike hollow of the down.

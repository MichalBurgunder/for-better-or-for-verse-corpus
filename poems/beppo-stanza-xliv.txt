I love the language, that soft bastard Latin,
-+-+-+-+-+
Which melts like kisses from a female mouth,
-+-+-+-+-+-
And sounds as if it should be writ on satin,
-+-+-+--++
With syllables which breathe of the sweet South,
-+-+-+-+-+-
And gentle liquids gliding all so pat in,
-+-+-+-+-+
That not a single accent seems uncouth.
--++-+-+-+--
Like our harsh northern whistling, grunting guttural,
-+-+-+-+-+--
Which weâ€™re obliged to hiss, and spit, and sputter all.

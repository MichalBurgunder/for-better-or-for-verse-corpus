+--+++-+-+
Batter my heart, three-personed God; for you
-+-+++-+-+
As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;
-+-+-+++--+|-+-+-+-+--+
That I may rise and stand, o’erthrow me and bend
-+-+++-+-+
force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
+---++--+-+
I, like an usurped town, to another due,
+---+--+-++
Labor to admit you, but O, to no end;
+--+--++--+
Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,
-++--++--+|+-+--++--+
But is captived, and proves weak or untrue.
-+--+--+-+-+
Yet dearly I love you, and would be lovèd fain,
-+-++--+-+
But am betrothed unto your enemy.
-+--+-+++-+|-+--+-+-+-+
Divorce me, untie or break that knot again;
+-+--+-+-+|+--+-+-+-+
Take me to you, imprison me, for I,
-+--+-+-+-+
Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,
-+-+-+-+-+
Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.

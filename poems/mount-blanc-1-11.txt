The everlasting universe of things
+--+-+-+-+
Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves,
-+-+--+-+-+
Now dark–now glittering–now reflecting gloom–
-+-+-+-+-+
Now lending splendour, where from secret springs
-+-+-+-+-+
The source of human thought its tribute brings
-+-+-+-+-+
Of waters,–with a sound but half its own,
+--+-+-+-+
Such as a feeble brook will oft assume
--++-+-+-+
In the wild woods, among the mountains lone,
-+-+-+-+-+-
Where waterfalls around it leap for ever,
-+-+-+--++-
Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river
+--++--+-+
Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves.

-+-++--+-+
That light whose smile kindles the Universe,
-+---+++-+
That Beauty in which all things work and move,
-+-+-+--+-+
That Benediction which the eclipsing curse
-+-++--+-+
Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love
-+-+-+-+-+
Which through the web of being blindly wove
-+-+-+-+-+
By man and beast and earth and air and sea,
++-+-+-+-+
Burns bright or dim as each are mirrors of
-+--+++++-+|-+--+++-+-+
The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me,
-+--++-+-+-+
Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.
-+-+-+-+-+
The breath whose might I have invoked in song
-+-+-+-+-+-
Descends on me; my spiritâ€™s bark is driven
+--++--+--+
Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng
-+-+-+-+-+-
Whose sails were never to the tempest given;
-+-+-+-+-+-
The massy earth and sphered skies are riven!
--++-+-+-+
I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;
-+-+-+-+-+-
Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,
-+-+-+-+-+
The soul of Adonais, like a star,
+-+--++--+-+
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.

Who travels by the wearie wandring way,
-++--+-+-+
To come vnto his wished home in haste,
-+-+-+-+-+
And meetes a flood, that doth his passage stay,
-+++-+-+-+
Is not great grace to helpe him ouer past,
-+-+-+-+++|-+-+---+++
Or free his feet, that in the myre sticke fast?
++--+-+-+-+
Most enuiman, that grieues at neighbours good,
-+-+-+-+-+
And fond, that ioyest in the woe thou hast,
+--+-+-+-+
Why wilt not let him pass, that long hath stood
-+-+-+-+++-+
Vpon the banke, yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood?
-+-+-+-+-+
He there does now enjoy eternall rest
-+-+-+-+-+
And happie ease, which thou doest want and craue,
-+-+-+-+-+
And further from it daily wanderest:
-+-+-+-+-+
What if some little paine the passage haue,
-+++-+-+-+
That makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue?
--++++-+++
Is not short paine well borne, that brings long ease,
-+-+-+-+-+
And layes the soule to sleepe in quiet graue?
+--++--+-+
Sleepe after toyle, port after stormy seas,
+--++--+-+-+
Ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.

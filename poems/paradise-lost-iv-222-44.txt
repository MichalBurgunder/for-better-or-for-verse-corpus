+--+-+-+-+
Southward through Eden went a river large,
-+-+-+-+-+
Nor chang’d his course, but through the shaggy hill
+--+-+-+-+|++-+-+-+-+
Pass’d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown
-+---+-+++
That mountain as his garden mould high 
-+-+-+-+-+
Upon the rapid current, which through veins
-+-+-+-+++|-+-+-+-+-+
Of porous Earth with kindthirst up-drawn,
+-++-+-+--+|+-++---+--+
Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill
+--+-+-+-+
Water’d the Garden; thence united fell
+-++-+-+-+
Down the steep glade, and met the nether Flood,
+--+-+-+-+|-+-+-+-+-+
Which from his darksome passage now appears,
-+-+---+++|-+-+-+-+++
And now divided into four main Streams,
+-++-+--+-+|++-+-+--+-+
Runs diverse, wand’ring many a famous Realm
-+-+-+-+-+
And try whereof here needs no account,
-+--++-+-+
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,
+--+-+-+-+
How from that Sapphire Fount the crisped Brooks,
+--+--+-+-+
Rolling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,
-+-+-+-+-+
With mazy error under pendant shades
++-+--++-+
Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed
++--+---+++|++--+-+-+++
Flow’rs worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art
-+-+--+-+-+
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon
++-+-+-+-+
Pour’d forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plain.

The sea is calm to night.

The tide is full, the moon lies fair

U pon the straits; on the French coast, the light

Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of Eng land stand,

Glim mer ing and vast, out in the tran quil bay.

Come to the win dow, sweet is the night -air!

Where the sea meets the moon -blanched land,

Lis ten! you hear the grat ing roar

Of peb bles which the waves draw back, and fling,

At their re turn up the high strand,

Be gin, and cease, and then a gain be gin,

With trem u lous ca dence slow, and bring

Ah, love, let us be true

To lie be fore us like a land of dreams,

So var i ous, so beaut i ful, so new,

Nor cer ti tude, nor peace, nor help for pain;

And we are here as on a dark ling plain
+--+-+-+--+
Swept with con fused a larms of strug gle and flight,
-+--+-+-+
Where ig nor ant arm ies clash by night.
